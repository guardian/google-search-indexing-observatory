# Ophan Google Search Index Checker

_Checking if Guardian content appears in Google search_
 
To understand more about this problem we are trying to solve check this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWOM-6mkGaPsI0YpF2HjrkI--6X1AlinaeIOhfmCy4I/edit?hl=en-GB&forcehl=1) 

## Steps performed by the checker

1. Hits the Guardian's Content API (CAPI) for stories published in the last few hours. 
2. Hits [Google Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/site_restricted_api)
   to check if our stories are available in Google search.
   [API Consumption](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/metrics?project=ophan-reborn-2017) &
   [Cost ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/cost?project=ophan-reborn-2017)
   for this can be monitored in the Google Cloud console.
3. Stores whether each article is available (or not) in an AWS DynamoDb table.
