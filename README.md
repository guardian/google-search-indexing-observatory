# Google Search Indexing Observatory

_How long does it take for content published by news organisations to be available in Google search?_

This broadens [Ophan's Google Search Index Checker](https://github.com/guardian/ophan-google-search-indexing-observatory)
to check for content published by _many_ news organisations, not just the Guardian. We're trying to work out if
the intermittent multi-hour delays we've seen for some Guardian articles to be available in Google Search are
typical for other news organisations too, or if there's actually something particular to the Guardian that needs
to be fixed.

It's an 'observatory' in the same way that the [EFF SSL Observatory](https://www.eff.org/observatory) is - creating
and collating observations of distant sites and processes that are visible to us but beyond our control.

## Steps performed by the Observatory

1. Fetch the Sitemap XML for a news site
2. Hit the [Google Custom Search Site Restricted JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/site_restricted_api)
   to check if the content listed is available in Google search.
   [API Consumption](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/metrics?project=ophan-reborn-2017) &
   [Cost ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/cost?project=ophan-reborn-2017)
   for this can be monitored in the Google Cloud console.
3. Stores whether each article is available (or not) in an AWS DynamoDb table.

## Running the Checker locally

### Pre-requisites

These mostly match [the pre-requisites for running Ophan locally](https://github.com/guardian/ophan/blob/main/docs/developing-ophan/running-ophan-locally.md#pre-requisites) -
specifically Java 11 & `sbt`, but also especially the requirement to have
[`ophan` AWS credentials](https://janus.gutools.co.uk/credentials?permissionId=ophan-dev)
from [Janus](https://janus.gutools.co.uk/).

### Running the Lambda locally

Execute this on the command line:

```bash
$ sbt run
```
